I only know one word : smart-contract.

I like to write new PoCs and explore new ideas.

From writing pooling contracts during 2017 craze (30k ETH handled) to writing the gas-efficient contracts for [Quantum.art](https://twitter.com/QuantumNFT), I lost count of projects and experiments deployed. 🫡🏄‍♂️
